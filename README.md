# Twitter_M1_IDD_Calvet_Besnier
Algo and Advanced programming project in M1 IDD , PSL Paris Dauphine University 2022-2023
Authors : Hugo Calvet and Matthias Besnier

Goal : The goal of this project is to recreate some Twitter features using API to communicate between our local web server and database. We're focusing on using
the best data structures to store and process the data depending on the features that we choose to implement.  

How does it work ? 
In the database there are some accounts you can use for testing features: 
Go to the signup feature 

name - mail - password 

Linda	L67@gmail.com - La
Samantha	S88@gmail.com - Sa
William	W92@gmail.com - Wm
Oscar	O98@gmail.com - Or
Jason	J85@gmail.com - Jn
Monica	M6@gmail.com - Ma
Sharon	S49@gmail.com - Sn
David	D9@gmail.com - Dd
Jesus	J41@gmail.com - Js
Kathy	K53@gmail.com - Ky
 
IMPORTANT : We use several package that you need to install to execute correctly the program 

numpy
scipy 
datetime
hashlib
networkx 
random
Levenshtein 

if you want to execute the python file script_data (creating a new table) you need to uncomment the main function and install the following package 

names_dataset
lorem_text

Bonus : You should be able to hear a goat bleatting when you push the button submit in the post a bleat
