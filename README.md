# Twitter_M1_IDD_Calvet_Besnier
Algo and Advanced programming project in M1 IDD , PSL Paris Dauphine University 2022-2023

Goal : The goal of this project is to recreate some Twitter features using API to communicate between our local web server and database. We're focusing on using
the best data structures to store and process the data depending on the features that we choose to implement.  

How does it work ? 
In the data base there are some accounts you can use for testing features: 
Id of connection
mail and password 
S15@gmail.com    Sa
J97@gmail.com    Js
