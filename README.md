# Twitter_M1_IDD_Calvet_Besnier
Algo and Advanced programming project in M1 IDD , PSL Paris Dauphine University 2022-2023
Authors : Hugo Calvet and Matthias Besnier

Goal : The goal of this project is to recreate some Twitter features using API to communicate between our local web server and database. We're focusing on using
the best data structures to store and process the data depending on the features that we choose to implement.  

How does it work ? 
In the database there are some accounts you can use for testing features: 
Go to the signup feature 

name - mail - password 
Stephanie	St3@gmail.com -  Se
Elizabeth	El6@gmail.com - Eh
Laura	La5@gmail.com - La
Joseph	Jo6@gmail.com - Jh
Christopher	Ch22@gmail.com - Cr 
Pedro	Pe32@gmail.com - Po
Angel	An2@gmail.com - Al
Jorge	Jo16@gmail.com - Je
Kimberly	Ki32@gmail.com - Ky 

 
IMPORTANT : We use several package that you need to install to execute correctly the program 

command line : pip install package_name

numpy
scipy 
datetime
hashlib
networkx 
random
Levenshtein 

if you want to execute the python file script_data (creating a new table) you need to uncomment the main function and install the following packages

names_dataset
lorem_text

Bonus : You should be able to hear a goat bleatting when you push the button submit in the post a bleat.
